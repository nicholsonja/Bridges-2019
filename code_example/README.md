# Code examples

These code examples, written in Python,
demonstrate the basic algorithm described in the paper.  
Due to the amount of computation, Python is a little slow 
yet allows the code to be simple for the purpose of understanding it.
Implementing the algorithm in a language such as C/C++ will improve rendering speeds.

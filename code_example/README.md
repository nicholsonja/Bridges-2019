# Code examples

These code examples, written in Python,
demonstrate the basic algorithm described in the paper.
Due to the amount of computation, Python is a little slow 
yet allows the code to be simple for the purpose of understanding it.
Implementing the algorithm in a language such as C/C++ will improve rendering speeds.

In order to run the code, you will need Python 3.6 or 3.7.  You also
need to install the NumPy and Pillow libraries. The files are
